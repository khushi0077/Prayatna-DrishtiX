Thank you for your interest in contributing. This project is maintained by Vikram and Harini.

How to contribute
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`.
- Keep changes small and focused; open one pull request per logical change.
- Write clear commit messages using the imperative mood.

Code style and testing
- Python: follow PEP8. Use `black`/`ruff` if available before submitting.
- Add unit tests for new functionality where practical.
- Run existing scripts and quick demos to ensure nothing breaks.

Issues and feature requests
- Open an issue describing the bug or feature with steps to reproduce and expected behavior.
- Tag maintainers by mentioning `@vikrammm24` or `@khushi0077` in the issue if immediate attention is needed.

Security
- Do not include secrets or API keys in commits. Use environment variables for credentials.
- For security-sensitive reports, contact the maintainers directly instead of opening a public issue.
